A personal engineering telemetry system built on [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) that observes development patterns in real-time and synthesizes weekly insights.

## Key Components

- **Hooks** - Shell scripts that observe Claude Code events
- **Cues** - Context-aware guidance injected when triggers match
- **Event Log** - Central storage for all captured activity
- **Weekly Review** - Automated synthesis of insights

## Purpose

Dev OS creates a persistent record of engineering work that surfaces:

- Where time is spent
- Where friction occurs
- What principles guide decisions
- How skills evolve over time
