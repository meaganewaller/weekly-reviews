A specific, actionable recommendation generated as part of the weekly review, targeting improvement in identified weak areas.

## Structure

Each precision move includes:

1. **Focus area** - Architecture, skill, or leverage
2. **Context** - Why this matters based on the week's data
3. **Concrete action** - Specific thing to do
4. **Success metric** - How to measure progress

## Example

> **Skill Deepening: Master File-Existence Guard Patterns**
>
> With 232 file-not-found errors dominating friction, develop muscle memory for defensive file operations. Every script should start with existence validation.
>
> *Concrete goal*: Implement `ensure_file_exists()` helper and use it in all new scripts next week.

## Categories

- **Architecture Focus** - System design improvements
- **Skill Deepening** - Deliberate practice targets
- **Leverage Move** - Multiplier actions (docs, tools, sharing)
