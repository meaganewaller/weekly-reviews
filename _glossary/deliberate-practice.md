Focused effort to improve specific skills identified through friction analysis, with concrete goals and metrics.

## Characteristics

Deliberate practice is:

- **Targeted** - Addresses specific skill gaps
- **Measurable** - Has clear success metrics
- **Time-bound** - Defined practice period
- **Feedback-rich** - Progress tracked via telemetry

## Structure

A deliberate practice plan includes:

1. **Skill gap** - What friction pattern revealed the gap
2. **Target behavior** - What to do differently
3. **Practice exercises** - Concrete actions
4. **Success metric** - How to measure improvement
5. **Timeline** - When to evaluate

## Example

> **Week 1-2: State Validation Pattern**
>
> - *Gap*: 232 file-not-found errors
> - *Target*: Add existence checks before file operations
> - *Practice*: Add `[ -f "$file" ]` guards to all new scripts
> - *Metric*: Reduce file-not-found errors by 50%

## Integration

Deliberate practice recommendations appear in:

- **Weekly review** - Friction analysis section
- **Precision moves** - Skill deepening recommendations
- **Session start** - Escalation reminders
